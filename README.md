Click on a stock from the Plot Stock Graph Dropdown to plot it's stock Graph.

**_NB: The UI will not be responsive because of processing, it will be responsive when the graph appears signalling end of processing_**

Save the graph that appears on the window that popups by clicking the save button, choose the location you want.

Exit the graph window to avoid errors while plotting another graph

Click on a stock from the Plot Hybrid Graph Dropdown to plot it's hybrid Graph.

**_NB: The UI will not be responsive because of processing, it will be responsive when the graph appears signalling end of processing_**

Open the 2 graphs side by side to compare the Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) displayed, this will help you know which model is accurate

**_NB: The lower the accuracy, the more accurate the model_**

In this case, the hybrid model performed better than the model with stock data only.
